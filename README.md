## Description

As lovers of travel, we wanted a place that users could go to share their trips. In addition, we wanted it to be available to confirm if a place is pet friendly and / or family friendly, and have a search functionality for users to filter through the posts made in the blog / forum. Finally, we wanted the ability to share these posts via email so users could make a note of where they may want to travel.

## Installation

No installation is required for the user to make use of the application from the deployed site.

## Technology Used

The application follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, SQL as the ORM, and express-session npm package for authentication.

Technologies used are as follows:

 - Node.js
 - MySQL2
 - Sequelize
 - Express
 - Dotenv
 - Heroku for deployment
 - Milligram as the CSS framework

## Usage

When the user pulls up the webpage, they will see 3 posts from the seed data. The user can then interact with the posts by viewing them individually and making comments.

If the user wants to add their own posts, they will then need to go to the Login page, where they will be prompted to log in or sign up. Once the user is logged in, the user can create a new post, as well as edit or delete their own posts.
